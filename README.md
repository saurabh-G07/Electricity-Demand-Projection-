This project aims to build a machine learning model that forecasts electricity demand for Delhi, India. By utilizing historical consumption data along with real-time parameters (such as weather conditions and time of day), the model helps optimize power distribution strategies and load management, ensuring efficient energy use in the region.

The tool is designed to assist utility companies and government agencies in better understanding energy consumption trends, reducing outages, and planning for peak demand.
